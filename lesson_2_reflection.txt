What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
   When I initialized a repository a new repository is created and a .git file is created 
   which has important information regarding the structure of repository.
   When we have multiple files, it makes sense to keep them together alongwith their individual 
   changes. So a repository is a collection of dependent files which you want to have a snapshot 
   each time you commit.
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
   Staging area can be imagined as an intermediate form of future commit. When you 
   add files in the staging area, and then after working on the files only the changes in files in staging 
   area are reflected in the repository when you commit. The working dir is the physical place where all your 
   files are present.  A repository is a collection of dependent files which you want to have a snapshot 
   each time you commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
   I would add only the files to the staging area which makes sense of having a logical commit.
   So when I commit I am sure it would be more meaningful.
