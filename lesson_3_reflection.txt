When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    It is very useful when your work machine is not always with you or you or someone else work through different machines.
    At that time remote repository can be very much in handy rather than carrying a backup of work alongwith.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Changes done in remote repository can cause problems or conflicts which you might want to avoid. Instead you may want to
    pull changes manually which are actually desirable to you.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
    
    Fork is similar to clones. 
    Clone applies to making copy locally while fork applies to making copy remotely on GitHub or other VCS.
    Branches are totally different from fork or clone. You use branches when you want to add changes retaining previous
    changes like while adding a new feature.
    You use clone when you want to make a remote or local repository copy locally. 
    Fork is used when you don't have permissions to make changes to some repository but at the same time you want
    to try out modifying it or reusing it.
